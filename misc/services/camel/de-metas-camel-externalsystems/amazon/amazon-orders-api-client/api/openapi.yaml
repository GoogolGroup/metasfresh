        | Plan type | Rate (requests per second) | Burst |

Rate limits for some selling partners will vary from the default rate and burst shown in the table above.

        Note: When an order is in the Pending state (the order has been placed but payment has not been authorized), the getOrderItems operation does not return information about pricing, taxes, shipping charges, gift status or promotions for the order items in the order. After an order leaves the Pending state (this occurs when payment has been authorized) and enters the Unshipped, Partially Shipped, or Shipped state, the getOrderItems operation returns information about pricing, taxes, shipping charges, gift status and promotions for the order items in the order.
